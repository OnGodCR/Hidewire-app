# Hidewire: test fixtures and simulated data

## Turning all of this off

**Set `TEST_MODE` to `false` in [mobile/src/config.ts](mobile/src/config.ts).**
That is the entire procedure. One boolean, one file. Nothing else needs
touching and nothing simulated survives it.

Without editing code:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_TEST_MODE=false npx expo start
```

A release build **must** have it false. `assertProductionSafe()` runs at app
start and throws if fixtures are enabled in a production bundle, so the mistake
fails loudly instead of shipping invented friends to real users.

`TEST_MODE_CONTROLS` in that file lists what the flag governs, so the effect of
flipping it is auditable without reading the codebase.

**Everything in this document is fake.** It exists so the app can be reviewed
without a backend, without four friends, and without a real camera. None of it
survives contact with a server.

Keep this current. When you add a fixture, add it here in the same commit.
When you replace one with real data, strike it here in the same commit.

Related: [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) 7 explains that there is no backend at all, which
is why so much of this exists.

## 1. How to spot a fixture in the app

Two conventions, both deliberate:

- **Simulated players are tagged `TEST`** in the lobby roster. A simulated name
  must never be able to pass for a person.
- **Nothing simulated arrives on its own.** The lobby starts empty and fills
  only when the host taps ADD TEST PLAYERS. This is a hard rule: unbidden
  arrivals read as stranger matchmaking, which the splash screen and
  marketing/BRIEF.md 9 both rule out.

## 2. Fixture inventory

| What | Where | Replaced by |
|---|---|---|
| Simulated party members | `SIM_SCHEDULE`, `screens/JoinLobby.tsx` | Realtime party channel |
| Bot hiders and the seeker | `HIDER_BOTS`, `SEEKER_BOT`, `engine/GameContext.tsx` | Real round rosters |
| The whole round timeline | `hiderScriptAuthored`, `seekerScriptAuthored`, `engine/GameContext.tsx` | Server tick worker |
| Invite code `7KFMQ2` | `partyCode`, `engine/GameContext.tsx` | Server-issued party codes |
| Friend directory | `DIRECTORY`, `data/friends.ts` | `profiles` table lookup by code |
| Global leaderboard ladder | `GLOBAL_LADDER`, `data/leaderboard.ts` | Ranked query on season XP |
| Friend feed captures | `ProceduralPhoto` seeds in `screens/Friends.tsx` | R2 photo URLs |
| Seeker proof feed photos | `round.photos`, `engine/GameContext.tsx` | Real uploads |
| All camera output on web | `components/CameraStage.tsx` fallback | Nothing: native uses the real camera |
| Rival seeker bid | `RIVAL_BID`, `screens/JoinLobby.tsx` | Real bids from the party |
| Baked Seattle world | `data/world.json` | Live Overpass fetch, already works |
| CONTINUE AS TEST ACCOUNT on the auth screen | `screens/AuthGate.tsx` | Real Google or Apple sign-in |
| Games near you | `NEARBY_GAMES`, `screens/tabs/LocationTab.tsx` | Geo query on open parties |
| Storefront country `US` | `TEST_STORE_COUNTRY`, `config.ts` | The payment provider's storefront country. Outside test mode this is null and `boxAvailability` fails closed, so the crate shelf is region-blocked until the real source exists. |

## 3. Friend codes that resolve in this build

Entering any other code correctly returns "No player with that code".

| Code | Handle | Level | Season XP | Posted today |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `KAY2XQ7M` | KAI | 9 | 8,420 | yes |
| `MAYA5TRW` | MAYA | 12 | 11,930 | yes |
| `DEV77KPZ` | DEV | 6 | 5,210 | no |
| `JUKE3NBH` | JULES | 15 | 14,680 | yes |
| `ARN9WQDF` | ARI | 4 | 3,140 | no |

These double as referral codes.

**Codes use a restricted alphabet** (`ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789`): no
I, L, O, 0, or 1, because codes get read aloud and typed by hand. An earlier
version of `normaliseCode` tried to "correct" confusable characters and instead
rewrote valid codes into different ones, so a correctly typed code failed to
match. It now only uppercases and strips punctuation. **Any fixture code must
use only alphabet characters** or it can never be entered successfully.

---

## 4. Your own friend code

Generated once per install and stored locally. It is random, so it differs on
every device and after every RESET PROGRESS. It resolves for nobody, because
the directory above is the only lookup that exists.

---

## 5. Simulated party arrivals

`SIM_SCHEDULE` in `screens/JoinLobby.tsx`, in seconds after ADD TEST PLAYERS:

| Offset | Name |
|---|---|
| 0 s | KAI (the seeker bot) |
| 1 s | MAYA |
| 2 s | DEV |
| 3 s | JULES |
| 4 s | ARI |

Each is READY two seconds after arriving. Minimum party is 3, maximum 6.

---

## 6. The round is entirely scripted

There is no opponent. `engine/GameContext.tsx` runs a fixed script:

- **Check-ins** fire at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 minutes, the real PRD 4.2 spacing.
  The window is 60 real seconds.
- **Ambient events** (a bot passing a check-in, a beacon being claimed, a zone
  contraction) were authored against an older 250 second compressed round and
  are **rescaled at module load** to spread across the full 30 minutes. See
  `rescale()`.
- **The seeker's BLE proximity** ramps on a timer, not on real Bluetooth.
- **Tagging** always succeeds when proximity is high enough.

`DEV_TIME_SCALE` speeds the clock up for review. **It ships at 1** and must
stay there.

---

## 7. Progression fixtures

`DEMO_SEED` in `engine/GameContext.tsx` is **false** and must ship false.

When true it starts an account at level 7 with 1,250 FILM and a partly
completed pass, purely so those screens can be screenshotted with content in
them. It was previously the default for every account, which meant a brand new
install opened twelve pass tiers into a season it had never played. That read
as a bug because it was one.

A real new account is `FRESH_PROFILE`: level 1, zero XP, zero FILM, default
cosmetics only.

---

## 8. Purchases are not real

No payment provider is wired up. Every price is display text.

`STORE` in `data/catalog.ts` is now **empty**, and `STARTER_BUNDLE` is retired.
Every paid SKU that used to be here is gone: the season pass paid track, the
darkroom set, both tier skips, the founder bundle, and the first-purchase
offer.

What replaced them, in `data/lootboxes.ts`:

| Surface | State |
|---|---|
| The five loot boxes | Fully playable in the demo: `openBox()` in `GameContext.tsx` deducts the FILM, **rolls client-side on the published odds**, grants the item into `profile.items`, and pays the duplicate refund. The client-side roll is itself a fixture: the real roll is `open_box()` in `0010_monetization.sql`, server-side, and the local one exists only so the store is playable before the client is wired up. The paid box opens free in TEST_MODE and refuses outside it. |
| `FILM_PACKS` | Tapping a pack grants its FILM, **TEST_MODE only** (`buyFilmPack`). No payment provider; outside test mode it is a no-op. |
| WATCH AN AD | Renders 250 FILM and the four-a-day cap. **No ad network is wired up** and the row grants nothing. |
| The twelve utility items | Defined, priced, rollable, and now grantable into a local inventory. **No round consumes one**, so nothing they describe actually happens in play. |

Two things about this that are not fixtures and should not be "fixed" by
wiring the client:

- **The roll belongs on the server**, as a SECURITY DEFINER function that
  checks age and region, debits FILM, and grants in one transaction. A
  client-side roll is worse than a client-side price.
- **`boxAvailability()` is called with a null country**, so the Belgium and
  Netherlands block never fires. That is a missing data source, not a decision.
  See [monetization/LOOT-BOXES.md](monetization/LOOT-BOXES.md) section 5.

**FILM is now sold**, which reverses the rule that used to live here. The
consequence to keep in view: seeker bidding spends FILM, so the seeker role is
now winnable with money.

## 9. Photos

Every image in the app is `ProceduralPhoto`, a seeded abstract generator, in
these places:

- The seeker's proof feed.
- The friend feed captures.
- The web camera fallback, since `expo-camera` needs a physical device.

**On a real device the check-in camera is real** and the validator runs on
real pixels. See `components/CameraStage.tsx` and `validation/decode.ts`.

The validator's thresholds are still **placeholders** and have never been
tuned against a real photograph. That is what `calibration/` is for, and until
those photos exist, expect the validator to reject valid captures.

---

## 10. Nearby games

`NEARBY_GAMES` in `screens/tabs/LocationTab.tsx`. Three invented open lobbies,
gated behind TEST_MODE like everything else.

| Host | Players | Distance shown | Starts in |
|---|---|---|---|
| VESPER | 4/6 | UNDER 500 M | 6 MIN |
| HALFLIGHT | 3/8 | UNDER 3 KM | 18 MIN |
| GRAIN | 5/6 | UNDER 3 KM | 31 MIN |

**ASK TO JOIN does nothing but flip the button.** There is no request, because
there is nobody to send one to.

Two things about this tab are **not** fixtures and must survive:

- **The 18+ gate is real**, driven by the age bracket from the DOB gate. A
  13-17 account sees the refusal screen, not an empty list.
- **Distances are coarse buckets by design**, not a rounding of a real number
  that a server will later make precise. Exact positions must never appear
  here. See the supersession note in CLAUDE.md 3.

The visibility toggle defaults off and is local only; it does not yet publish
anything anywhere, because there is nowhere to publish to.

---

## 11. Missions

`data/missions.ts`. The missions themselves are **not** fixtures: they are
derived from real state (practised, daily done, rounds today) and the 100 FILM
sweep bonus really is paid and really is guarded against double payment.

What is worth knowing is that `roundsToday` counts **scripted** rounds, since
every round is scripted. It becomes real the moment rounds do.

---

## 12. The account boundary is not a fixture

Guests genuinely cannot use the shop, FILM, friends, the leaderboard, or
referrals, and that is **not** enforced by the client. Every social table keys
off `profiles`, which keys off `auth.users`, so a guest has no row to own
anything with and every policy fails on `auth.uid() is null`. See
`supabase/migrations/0002_social.sql`.

`components/AccountGate.tsx` exists so the app reads honestly rather than
failing mysteriously. Deleting it would not open a hole.

**CONTINUE AS TEST ACCOUNT** on the auth screen is a fixture, and the one place
that boundary is faked. It exists because the Supabase OAuth redirect for Expo
Go is still unconfigured, so there is otherwise no way to review account-only
screens. It disappears with TEST_MODE.

## 13. Before any public build

- [ ] `TEST_MODE` is false in `src/config.ts`
- [ ] `DEMO_SEED` is false
- [ ] `DEV_TIME_SCALE` is 1
- [ ] `ADD TEST PLAYERS` is removed or gated behind a dev flag
- [ ] `DIRECTORY` is replaced by a real profile lookup
- [ ] `GLOBAL_LADDER` is replaced by a real ranked query
- [ ] `RIVAL_BID` is replaced by real bids
- [ ] `NEARBY_GAMES` is replaced by a real geo query, and ASK TO JOIN sends a
      real request
- [ ] CONTINUE AS TEST ACCOUNT is gone and OAuth works end to end
- [ ] The 18+ gate on NEARBY is tested with a 13-17 account, not just an adult
      one
- [ ] Store buttons are wired to a real payment provider
- [ ] Validator thresholds are calibrated against real photos
- [ ] `ios.bundleIdentifier` and `android.package` are changed off the
      `org.hidewire.app` placeholder, which is permanent once published
