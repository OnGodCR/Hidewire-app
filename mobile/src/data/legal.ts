// DRAFT. Not reviewed by a lawyer. PRD 7.8 is explicit that the
// assumption-of-risk and limitation-of-liability language must be reviewed by
// an actual attorney before public launch, and that is still outstanding. This
// covers the ground that matters and is written to be read, not to be
// impenetrable, but do not ship it as-is.
//
// The same text lives in legal/TERMS.md and legal/PRIVACY.md for the public
// web pages, which App Review requires you to link.

      body: [
        'You must be 13 or older. We ask for your date of birth once, and if you are under 13 we refuse the account and remember that refusal on the device.',
        'If you are between 13 and 17, you get non-personalised advertising only, and we do not ask you to allow tracking.',

      heading: '2. You are responsible for where you go',
      body: [
        'This is the important one. Hidewire shows you places and gives you reasons to walk to them. It does not know whether the route is safe, whether the property is public, or what is happening at that location right now. You do.',
        'You agree to stay on public property, obey the law, keep away from traffic, and stop playing the moment anyone with authority over a place asks you to.',
        'You accept the risks that come with moving around in the physical world, including injury, and you accept them for yourself rather than for us. If you would not do it without the game, do not do it because of the game.',
        'Do not play while driving. The app suspends itself above 10 mph, but that is a backstop and not a permission slip.',

      body: [
        'The game requires you to photograph where you are hiding. Those photos go to the seeker in your party, and to spectators if the host enabled that.',
        'Do not photograph other people deliberately, do not photograph inside private spaces, and do not submit anything you would be uncomfortable having a friend see.',
        'Photos are deleted permanently 24 hours after a round ends. They are not kept in your match history and they are not used to train anything.',
        'You keep ownership of your photos. You give us permission to store and show them to your party for the duration described above, and nothing beyond that.',

        'You can buy FILM and one box containing a random item. Some of those items do change how a round plays. Three limits: the seeker role cannot be bought, because bidding spends only FILM you earned and that is enforced in our database; one utility item per player per round; and nothing is purchase-only, so every item is reachable by playing. Odds are published before you buy. Nothing purchasable rewards taking a physical risk.',

      heading: '7. Limitation of liability',

        'Hidewire is provided as-is. To the maximum extent the law allows, we are not liable for indirect or consequential damages, and our total liability is limited to what you have paid us in the last twelve months.',
        'Nothing here limits liability that cannot be limited by law, including for death or personal injury caused by negligence on our part.',
