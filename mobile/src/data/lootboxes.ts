// Loot boxes, utility items, and the odds.
//
// **Read monetization/LOOT-BOXES.md before changing anything in this file.**
// Three things in here are compliance, not design, and they are easy to break
// by accident:
//
//   1. **Every odds table must sum to exactly 1.** `assertOdds()` at the bottom
//      throws at module load if one does not, because a table that sums to 0.98
//      is a published probability that is a lie.
//   2. **The odds must be reachable from the purchase screen**, before the
//      purchase. Apple has required this since 2017 and Google Play since 2019;
//      it is statutory in China and South Korea.
//   3. **Availability is gated by age bracket and by country**, not by taste.
//      See `boxAvailability()`. Belgium treats a box bought with a currency
//      that can be bought with money as gambling, and PEGI gives any game with
//      paid random items a 16 minimum from June 2026.
//
// The tiers exist because the request was for four FILM boxes with a better
// high-tier chance as the price climbs, plus one paid box. That shape is here.
// What it costs is in LOOT-BOXES.md section 2, and it is not a small bill.
